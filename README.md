# Thermostat-Project
This thermostat project integrates various peripherals to monitor room temperature, control a heating element (simulated by an LED), and report data to a cloud server. It solves the problem of automated temperature control with user-defined set-points, enhancing both comfort and energy efficiency.

# Strengths
I effectively handled peripheral integration, especially managing I2C, GPIO, and UART for temperature sensing, button interactions, and communication. The code structure and timing adjustments supported seamless data handling.

# Areas for Improvement
I could enhance error handling and optimize timing controls to avoid potential bottlenecks in sensor reading and reporting processes.

# Added Tools and Resources
Adding resources like TI’s and Microchip’s datasheets, along with debugging tools and cloud API documentation, significantly expanded my support network.

# Transferable Skills
Skills like embedded system integration, peripheral handling, and state machine design are highly transferable to other IoT projects and real-time embedded coursework.

# Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I ensured maintainability with modular code, clear documentation, and a logical structure for easy updates and adaptability. This approach allows other developers to extend functionality or troubleshoot effectively in future adaptations.
